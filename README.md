A binary array is an array consisting of only the values 0 and 1. Given a binary array of any length, return an array of positive integers that represent the lengths of the sets of consecutive 1's in the input array, in order from left to right.

nonogramrow([]) => []
nonogramrow([0,0,0,0,0]) => []
nonogramrow([1,1,1,1,1]) => [5]
nonogramrow([0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1]) => [5,4]
nonogramrow([1,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0]) => [2,1,3]
nonogramrow([0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,1,1]) => [2,1,3]
nonogramrow([1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,1]) => [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
